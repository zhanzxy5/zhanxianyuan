Abstract
---
This article presents a sequential method to estimate the direct transportation economic impacts (DTEI) related to transportation due to disruptions in highway networks used by trucks and cars. The main input is the Freight Analysis Framework version 3, best public data for truck movements in the United States. The method considers multicommodity flows in an equilibrium framework, associates monetary values to changes in traffic conditions that are specific to each user type, and links truck flows with commodity flows. This approach can consider transportation analysis zones smaller than those presented in the Freight Analysis Framework. A real-world numerical example is presented to estimate the DTEI due to severe floods that occurred in 2008 and disrupted key segments of the highway network in the northwestern Indiana region.
