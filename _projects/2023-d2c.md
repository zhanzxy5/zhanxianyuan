<b>D2C</b> (<b>D</b>ata-<b>d</b>riven <b>C</b>ontrol Library) is a library for data-driven decision-making & control based on state-of-the-art offline reinforcement learning (RL), offline imitation learning (IL), and offline planning algorithms. It is a platform for solving various decision-making & control problems in real-world scenarios. D2C is designed to offer fast and convenient algorithm performance development and testing, as well as providing easy-to-use toolchains to accelerate the real-world deployment of SOTA data-driven decision-making methods.

The current supported offline RL/IL algorithms include (<b>more to come</b>):

- [Twin Delayed DDPG with Behavior Cloning (TD3+BC)](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2106.06860.pdf)
- [Distance-Sensitive Offline Reinforcement Learning (DOGE)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2205.11027.pdf)
- [Dynamics-Aware Hybrid Offline-and-Online Reinforcement Learning (H2O)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2206.13464.pdf)
- [Sparse Q-learning (SQL)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.15810)
- [Policy-guided Offline RL (POR)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.08323)
- [Offline Reinforcement Learning with Implicit Q-Learning (IQL)](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2110.06169.pdf)
- [Discriminator-Guided Model-Based Offline Imitation Learning (DMIL)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2207.00244)
- [Behavior Cloning (BC)](http://www.cse.unsw.edu.au/~claude/papers/MI15.pdf)

## Features:

- D2C includes a large collection of offline RL and IL algorithms: model-free and model-based offline RL/IL algorithms, as well as planning methods. 

- D2C is highly modular and extensible. You can easily build custom algorithms and conduct experiments with it.

- D2C automates the development process in real-world control applications. It simplifies the steps of problem definition/mathematical formulation, policy training, policy evaluation and model deployment.
